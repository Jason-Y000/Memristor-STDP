# Memristor-STDP

Analysis code for assessing the "learning" capabilities of memristor devices. Procedure was to stimulate the memristor with sequences of paired pulse spikes that were generated with MATLAB and delivered via a Keithley 4200. The resulting current and voltage results were then analyzed to generate curves that plotted synaptic weight change against paired pulse time separation.
